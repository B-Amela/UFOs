## Summary
#### Drawback
A drawback of the filters includes knowing what to search for. Entering random cities does not provide all of the results, the display will only include the cities from the list. 
#### Recommendations
- Drop down of all available cities, it would provide easier access of the available data. Decreases trial and error.
- Tally of occurences within each city would be a valuable. It would allow for anyone to know where the most common sightings are without having to dig too far for the information.
